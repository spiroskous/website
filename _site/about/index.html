<p>Hi to Everyone - Γειἀ σε όλους  - Hallo !</p>

<p>My name is Spiros and I am passionate with the Computer Security and the current Technological trends.</p>

<p>On this page I will give you a small background from my first touch with the Computer systems and how I decided to work on the field of Computer Security.
At the end you can find my CV for more details of my career.</p>

<p>My first computer was obtained in 1995 (MS-DOS) when my father´s friend gave him his old computer. It was something incredible having such a machine in our house. My first PC game was the “Homey D Clown” for which the installation period was almost 2 days. It was so amusing playing around in 2-D dimensions with my siblings. It was the period that you open your pc just to play games, no internet connection, no windows environment, no CD driver. Every time that you wanted to play your game you had to insert this big floppy disc in your PC and then to type the specific commands in the terminal.  Even your mouse it was using a roller ball that you had to clean it from the dust in order to work properly.</p>

<p>The years passed, and the computers start using Windows environment. The first CD PC games came out and the black and green screen was replaced by a new coloured screen with the logo of the windows during the starting process. In 1999 I had my first modem (PSTN-64Kbps) and I still remember the characteristic sound of the modem while it was trying to connect to the internet. Fewer web pages to visit which you had to remember them while typing them carefully on the internet explorer search bar. We did not really use the search engines such as yahoo and google which became more popular after 2000s.</p>

<p>My first experience with PC viruses and the hackers came in 2002. On that period the companies were using the telephony bill in order to charge you for the usage of the Mbps that you had consumed. My system had been infected by a virus and I realised that only when my 2-months phone bill came with a 2000 Euros debt.</p>

<p>This incident was influenced me in a way to learn more about Computer systems and how I can protect them.</p>
